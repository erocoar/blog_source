## About

`ggparl` is a small R package for conveniently drawing parliament diagrams with `ggplot2`. For now, it consists of only two functions, the usage of which is outlined below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("erocoar/ggparl")
library(ggparl)
```

## ggplot_parliament

`ggplot_parliament` draws a parliament diagram that looks much like the diagrams seen on Wikipedia. Points along an arc are clustered by parties with each point representing a single member of parliament. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# creating sample data
bt <- data.frame(
        parties = c("CDU", "CSU", "SPD", "AfD", "FDP", "Linke", "Gruene", "Fraktionslos"),
        seats   = c(200, 46, 153, 92, 80, 69, 67, 2),
        colors  = c("black", "blue", "red", "lightblue", "yellow","purple", "green", "grey"),
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# vector is drawn from left to right, unless autosort is set to TRUE,
# in which case vector is drawn from left to right sorted from most to least members
ggplot_parliament(bt$parties, bt$seats, bt$colors)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
df <- data.frame(
  "Parties" = c("SPÖ", "PILZ", "NEOS", "ÖVP", "FPÖ",
                "CRCE", "SOC", "RDSE", "REM", "LIRT", "UC", "LR", "RASNAG",
                "MPRP", "MPP", "DP", "Independent",
                "CPV", "Independent"),
  "Members" = c(52, 8, 10, 62, 51,
                15, 78, 21, 21, 11, 50, 146, 6,
                1, 65, 9, 1,
                475, 25),
  "Colors"  = c("red", "grey", "pink", "black", "blue",
                "red", "darksalmon", "purple", "yellow", "deepskyblue3", "cyan", "blue", "grey",
                "brown", "red", "midnightblue", "grey",
                "red", "lightpink2"),
  "Country" = rep(c("Austria", "France", "Mongolia", "Vietnam"), c(5, 8, 4, 2)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

p <- by(df, df$Country, function(x) {
  ggplot_parliament(x$Parties, x$Members, x$Colors) + 
    ggtitle(x$Country[1]) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
})

do.call(grid.arrange, p)
```

## ggplot_parliament2

`ggplot_parliament2` draws an arc bar chart with optional spacing showing the parties' proportional representation in parliament. This is much like `ggforce`'s [`geom_arc_bar`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggforce/vignettes/Visual_Guide.html#arcs) but always draws from $\pi$ to $0$ / left to right, without any angle specification required. It also features an optional spacing argument, specified as total spacing as a proportion of $\pi$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot_parliament2(bt$parties, bt$seats, bt$colors, sep = 0.05)
```

## Future

While the current use is obviously limited, I plan to in the future extend ggparl to include more functions for convenient visualization of data frequently encountered in politics. If you want to see a certain feature, you can file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/erocoar/ggparl) - that is also where you can find the code :)
